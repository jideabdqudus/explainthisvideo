		"title": "Elon Musk: Digital Superintelligence, Multiplanetary Life, How to Be Useful",
		"description": "A fireside with Elon Musk on June 17, 2025 at AI Startup School in San Francisco. Before rockets and robots, Elon Musk was drilling holes through his office floor to borrow internet. In this candid talk, he walks through the early days of Zip2, the Falcon 1 launches that nearly ended SpaceX, and the “miracle” of Tesla surviving 2008. He shares the thinking that guided him—building from first principles, doing useful things, and the belief that we’re in the middle of an intelligence big bang.",

	"transcript": "00:00 we're at the very very early stage of the intelligence big bang being a multilanet species greatly increases the probable lifespan of civilization or consciousness or intelligence both biological and digital i think we're quite close to digital super intelligence if it doesn't happen this year next year for sure please give it up for Elon Musk elon welcome to AI Startup School we're just really really blessed to have your presence here today uh thanks for having me so uh from SpaceX Tesla Neurolink XAI and more was there ever a moment in your life uh before all this where you felt I have to build something great and what flipped that switch for you uh well I didn't originally think I would build something great um I wanted to try to build something useful but uh I didn't think I would build anything particularly great if you said probabilistically seemed unlikely uh but I wanted to at least try so you're talking to uh a room full of people who are all technical engineers uh often you know some of the most eminent AI researchers coming up in the game okay i uh I think we should I think that I I like the term engineer better than researcher i mean I suppose if if there's some fundamental algorithmic breakthrough it's it's a research but otherwise it's engineering maybe let's start way back i mean when you were this is a room full of 18 to 25 year olds um it skews younger because the founder set is younger and younger uh can you put yourself back into their shoes when you know you were 18 19 you know learning to code uh even coming up with a first idea for zip 2 what was that like for you yeah back in 95 I I was faced with a choice of either do uh you know grad studies PhD at Stanford uh in in material science actually working on ultra capacitors for potential use in electric vehicles essentially trying to solve the range problem for electric vehicles uh or uh try to do something in this thing that most people have never heard of called the internet and um I talked to my professor who was Bill Nyx in the material science from and uh said like um can I like defer for a quarter uh because this will probably fail and then I'll need to come back to college and um and then he said this is probably the last conversation we'll have uh and he was right um so but I I thought things would most likely fail not that they would most likely succeed um and um and then in 95 I wrote uh basically I think the first or close to the first maps directions uh internet white pages and yellow pages on the internet um I just wrote I just wrote that personally and I didn't even use a web server i just read the port directly because I um couldn't afford uh and I couldn't couldn't afford a T1 uh original office was on Sherman Avenue in Palo Alto uh there was like an ISP on the floor below so I drilled a drilled a hole through the floor and just uh ran a land cable directly to the ISP um and um you know uh my brother joined me and another co-founder Greg Curry who passed away and um we at the time we couldn't even afford a a place to stay so we just the the office was 500 bucks a month so we just slept in the office and and then showered at the YMCA on Paige Millino um and uh yeah and we I guess we ended up doing a little bit of a useful company uh Zip 2 in the beginning um and um we we we did build a lot of uh really really good software technology but we were somewhat captured by the legacy media companies and that nighter New York Times host whatnot were investors and uh customers and and also on the board uh so they ke they they kept wanting to use our software in ways that made no sense um so I I wanted to go direct to consumers anyway long story dwelling too much on Z2 but the I really just wanted to do something useful on the internet um as because I had like two choices like do a do a PhD and watch people build the internet or help build the internet in some small way and I was like well I guess I can always try and fail and then go back to grad studies um and uh anyway that ended up being like reasonably successful sold for like $300 million which is a lot at the time these days that's like I think the minimum impulse bid for an AI startup is like a billion dollars um it's like a there's so many freaking unicorns it's like a herd of unicorns at this point you know unicorn is a billion dollar situation um there's been inflation since so quite a bit more money actually yeah i mean like 90 1995 you could probably buy a burger for a nickel well not quite but I mean yeah there has been a lot of inflation um but uh I mean the hype level on AI is is is pretty intense as you've seen um you know you see uh companies that are I don't know less than a year old getting sometimes billion dollar or multi-billion dollar valuations um which I guess could could pan out and probably will pan out in some cases um but uh it is eye watering to see some of these valuations um yeah what do you think i mean well I'm pretty bullish personally i'm I'm pretty bullish honestly",
